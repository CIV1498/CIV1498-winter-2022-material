    "## 6. APIs\n",
    "The term API is an acronym, and it stands for **Application Programming Interface**. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs provide a means of collecting data with certain advantages over the file formats previously discussed. When would we want to use an API instead of a static CSV file you can download from the web?\n",
    "1. When you only want a small piece of a much larger dataset. For example, Donald Trump likes to Tweet alot. If you're only interested in Trump's Tweets from the last 12 hours, the Twitter API will save you from having to download all of Trump's Tweets and then searching the ones you're interested in.\n",
    "2. When the data is changing quickly. For example, if you're trying to build a high frequency trading alogrithm for the stock market, you're algorithm is going to need access to \"real-time\" data. Stock Exchange APIs can provide this kind of \"real-time\" data.\n",
    "3. When the API provides some kind of computational functionality that you need for your analysis. For example, you might be interested in using drone imagery to estimate the rooftop solar potential in your neighbourhood. To to this, you need to be able to segment the rooftops in an image from their surrounding background. Perhaps a research group has made their Machine Learning rooftop segmentation model available via an API endpoint. In this case, you could send the API a JPEG and get back a rooftop mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does an API work?\n",
    "An API runs on a remote server typically use HTTP as their transfer protocol. You can send data to an API and also retrive data, which will be the focus of thus Lecture. We use APIs all the time, probably without knowing it. For example, if you click on this link [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) (cool website, check it out) your web browser (Chrome, Explorer, Firefox, Safari) will make a request to get the webpage data so it can display it for you.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/API.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are many different types of requests that you can make, such as: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, but for this lecture, we'll explore the GET requet. The diagram above presents the basic function of a GET request. We send information to the API specifying what data we want and the API will return the data we request and a response code indicating the status of the request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common response codes:\n",
    "- **200 (OK)** | Indicates that the API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested.\n",
    "- **400 (Bad Request)** | The generic client-side error status indicating that you messed something up with your request. Check for errors in your code and try again.\n",
    "- **500 (Internal Server Error)** Something send wrong on the server side and is not the client’s fault. It is reasonable for the client to retry the same request that triggered this response and hope to get a different response.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about status codes [here](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the Foreign exchange rates API **https://exchangeratesapi.io/**. Do do this programmatically in Python, we'll be using the **requests** package that was imported at the start of the Notebook.\n",
